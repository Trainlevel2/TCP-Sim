Router
	Functions:
		Router constructor
		getLinks - retrieves all links connected to the router
		chooseLink - decide which link to send a given packet to given a routing algorithm. 
			At first, we will test the network by using a random routing algorithm. 
			Afterwards, this routing algorithm will be implemented via the routing table.
		receivePacket - receive packet, and modify routing table and packet header information accordingly.
	Data Structures:
		list<Link> links - list of links that a router is connected to (we plan to use the included list class in C++)
		queue<packet> buffer - a queue of packets in the router, erased when at full capacity, 
			that processes packets in the order in which they arrive (we plan to use the provided queue class in C++)
		routing table - a structure similar to a hash table that will determine the routing algorithm

Host (extends Router)
	Functions:
		All functions found in Router.
		Host - the constructor creates the Host object, and initializes all data shown in “Data Structures.”
		makePacket - uses input data (data, path), as well as environmental data (time) to create a new packet to be sent.
		getTimeStamp - get the timestamp of a packet, or the amount of time it took for a packet to reach its destination.
	Data Structures:
		All data structures found in Router.
Packet
	Functions:
		Packet- the constructor creates the Packet object, and initializes all data shown in “Data Structures”.
	Data Structures:
		data - the contents of the packet. May be random information, or specific information as appropriate.
		header - contains three things:
		int timestamp - when the packet was first sent.
		Router* destination - where the packet is headed.
		Router* source - the source host name.

node
	Functions:
		
		node - constructs node
		
		getLinks - retrieves all links connected to the router
		
		chooseLink - decide which link to send a given packet to given a routing algorithm. At first, we will test the network by using a random routing algorithm. Afterwards, this routing algorithm will be implemented via the routing table.
		
		receivePacket - receive packet, and modify routing table and packet header information accordingly.
